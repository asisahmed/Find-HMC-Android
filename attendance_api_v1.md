AbilityLoft Attendance API v1.1
We want to implement a simple app to let all our employees track their attendance times. We created a rough description within the attached file, I hope the whole concept is understandable. 


Thanks,

## User data (5 methods):
1. Authenticate with Google GSuite (e.g. oAuth)
2. Destroy the session
3. get user data
GET /api/v1/me
{
	"data": {
		"id":123,
		"email":"john.doe@abilityloft.com",
		"firstname":"John",
        "lastname":"Doe",
		"language":"de_DE",

4. set user data
PUT /api/v1/me

A user can update the following fields:
email: string, valid email
firstname:  string

language:   string

5. get all users
GET /api/v1/users
To get a successful response, the user must be manager. A successful response is an array of workspace users:

created_with: the name of your client app (string, required)
description:  an optional note (string)
uuid:         the own UUID of this entry, (string, set by the server)
related:      the UUID of the related "in"/"out" entry
valid:        "valid", "rejected" or "validation_required" (string, set by the server)

GET "/api/v1/time_entries?start_date=2017-07-10T15%3A42%3A46%2B02%3A00&end_date=2017-07-12T15%3A42%3A46%2B02%3A00"

Report-API (2 methods)
======================
Reports are used to display the logged time. Use cases are: 
+ get a single report of the current logged in user's entries as overview for a single user     <- defined here
+ get many reports for a manager (of all his subordinates)                  <- same as the above but grouped by employees

1. get per day report (employee)
GET /api/v1/reports/perday
With start_date and end_date parameters you can specify the date range of the time entries returned. If start_date and end_date are not specified, all time entries for the current week are returned. start_date and end_date must be ISO 8601 date and time strings.
This will be used for a list like this:
    #date         #in       #out      #breaktime    #workhours    #status       #note
    2017/07/17    7:20      17:20     30            9:30          approved
    2017/07/18    7:50      17:20     30            9:00          pending       I forgot to punch in, sorry

This report should query the time_calculations. Logic proposal: whenever a time entry is logged/changed in time entries, this time+uuid combination should also be created/updated in time_calculations.

Successful response:
[
	{
		"date":"2017-07-17",
        "in":"07:20:00+00:00",
        "out":"17:20:00+00:00",
        "breaktime":"30",
        "workhours":"9:30",
        "status":"approved",
        "description":null
	},{
		"date":"2017-07-18",
        "in":"07:50:00+00:00",
        "out":"17:20:00+00:00",
        "breaktime":"30",
        "workhours":"9:00",
        "status":"pending",
        "description":"I forgot to punch in, sorry"
	}
]

2. get overtime report (employee)
GET /api/v1/reports/overtime?year
returns an overview for the whole year, ordered by year
Successful response:
[
	{
        "week":1,
        "workhours_plan":40,
        "workhours_actual":41,
        "status":"approved"
    },
    {
        "week":2,
        "workhours_plan":40,
        "workhours_actual":32,
        "status":"approved"
    }
